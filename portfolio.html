      <p class="port-text">This is one of my favorite crochet projects, a turtle! But it’s just one of the many amigurumi or stuffed animal projects I have made, and I have also crocheted clothing like scarves and hats. I especially love to crochet because it allows me to create handmade gifts people of all ages will love! My crocheting skills come especially in handy when there's a birthday coming up soon, I can whip up a cute amigurumi plush to give to friends and family in just a few hours.</p>

      <p class="port-text">This is one of my favorite art projects I made in art class, and it even got displayed in my school! I created it using oil pastels, colored pencils, and Sharpie, and the task was to create a stylistic letter of the alphabet using these materials; I really like how it came out in the end! I’m also involved in my school's art club and I have always fostered a passion for any type of art, such as drawing, painting, sculpting, etcetera.</p>
